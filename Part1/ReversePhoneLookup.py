# Question 3
# You have been asked to write a function that supplies the "reverse lookup" name for the person associated with a phone number.
# This means that given a phone number, you get the name of the person
# who is registered with that phone number. Write this function using parallel lists.

    # of phone numbers phone_numbers and a list of names names.  These lists are
    # parallel lists, so the name in position 0 of the names list is
    # associated with the phone number in position 0 of the phone_numbers
    # list, and so on.

    # Return the name associated with phone_num according to phone_numbers
    # and names, or an empty string if there is no match.
