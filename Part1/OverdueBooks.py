# A library charges overdue fees for a borrowed book using the following fee schedule:
#                       less than 4 days late: 1 dollar per day
#                       4 to 6 days late: 2 dollars per day (for all days, including the first 3 days)
#                       more than 6 days late: 3 dollars per day (for all days, including the first 6 days)
#
# Borrowers of books are in one of these age groups: CHILD, ADULT, or SENIOR. A CHILD gets charged only half of the fees and a SENIOR gets charged only one quarter of the fees.
# An ADULT pays the full fee.
